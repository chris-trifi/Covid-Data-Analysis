# COVID Data Analysis

Welcome to the COVID Data Analysis project, a comprehensive exploration conducted as part of the 'Data Analysis' course at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki (2022). This repository features a set of Matlab scripts, used to analyse various COVID-19 data.

## Project Highlights

### Ex1: Distribution of Positivity Rates for Europe
Explore and fit positivity rates into known distributions across Europe.

### Ex2: Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test
Conduct Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests on positivity rate distributions across different time intervals, incorporating Bootstrap calculations for statistical significance.

### Ex3: Comparative Analysis of Greek Positivity Rates
Compare Greek positivity rates to European rates over a 12-week period, utilizing Bootstrap methods with a significance level of 5%.

### Ex4: Temporal Changes in Positivity Rates
Investigate if positivity rates significantly changed in 2021 compared to 2020 in five different countries, employing parametric and bootstrap tests.

### Ex5: Correlation Coefficient Significance Tests
Conduct significance tests, both parametric and bootstrap, on correlation coefficients between positivity rates in pairs of countries.

### Ex6: Equivalence of Correlation Coefficients
Utilize bootstrap tests to assess the equivalence of correlation coefficients for two pairs of countries.

### Ex7: Regression Model Comparison
Explore and compare regression models predicting deaths based on positivity rates in preceding weeks.

### Ex8: Predicting Deaths in Greece
Utilize positivity rates from previous days to predict deaths in Greece, applying PCA to reduce feature dimensions.

### Ex9: Model Evaluation with Cross-Validation
Evaluate the model developed in Ex8 using a 5-fold cross-validation approach.

### Ex10: Tubed Patients to Predict Deaths
Investigate predicting deaths using the number of tubed patients from previous days, incorporating PCA.
